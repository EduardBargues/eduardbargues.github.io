## Current job

### Migracode

I was lucky enough to find [Migracode](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/) and being able to merge my programming passion and my will to help others. Teaching refugees to become full-stack developers. Stack: Git, Javascript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Heroku. I also take care of a self-developed soft-skills curriculum about emotional intelligence, team-work, conflict management and working under pressure.

### Ohpen

Currently, I'm working as a Platform-Lead at [Ohpen](https://www.ohpen.com/) where I keep pushing my AWS+Serverless knowledge every day. Designing and implementing serverless systems for finance institutions in AWS. Owning the whole process. From CI/CD pipelines, deployments, monitoring and bug resolution. Mainly using AWS, Serverless, DynamoDB, RDS, Aurora, .Net, Node.js, Powershell and Python.
